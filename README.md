## Building

Before building the project, the following tools must be installed: 
* [JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Spring Boot CLI](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-installing-the-cli)
* [Grails](https://grails.org/download)
* [Typesafe Activator](https://typesafe.com/platform/getstarted)

This project is built with Gradle. After installing the pre-requisites, run:

```plain
./gradlew
```

### Building Behind a Proxy
Since this project downloads its dependencies from the internet, building behing a proxy requires some extra effort.  In order configure gradle properly, use the following system properties.  More information can be found [here][].

```plain
./gradlew -Dhttp.proxyHost=<HOST> -Dhttp.proxyPort=<PORT>
```

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry
Each test application contains a `manifest.yml` file which allows the built application to be deployed to Cloud Foundry by simply issuing:

```plain
cf push
```

To avoid clashing with the URLs of other applications, you should specify your own subdomain for the application (unless the test application does not need a subdomain).

## Failure Testing
Failure testing is supported for each of the above applications by setting a suitable environment variable.

If the environment variable FAIL_INIT is set, the application will fail to initialize:

```plain
cf set-env <application name> FAIL_INIT true
```

If the environment variable FAIL_OOM is set, the application will repeatedly exhaust the heap until the JVM is killed:

```plain
cf set-env <application name> FAIL_OOM true
```

## Running Tests
To run the tests, do the following:

```bash
./gradlew
```
